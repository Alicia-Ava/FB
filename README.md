Before unleashing chaos, acquaint yourself with Facebook's policies. Know the rules and guidelines to stay compliant with the system.

#### Demo Report:
```
Hello FB Team,
My Profile name is......... I received content monetisation policies on my Facebook profile. Some unoriginal videos were uploaded to my profile by mistake. I didn't know about Facebook's Community Guidelines along with content monetization policies. Now I know all Facebook community guidelines and content monetisation policies. So I deleted the unoriginal videos. Apologies for this unintentional mistake. Please review my profile and eliminate content monetization policy issues. I apologize again. Please, give me set up permission for in-stream ads including other monetization tools.
Sincerely,
(Your Profile name)

```

### Step 4: Appeal if Necessary
Should your account face the guillotine due to policy violations, appeal. Craft a compelling case, explaining your situation with the finesse of a true mischief-maker.

#### Partner Monetization Policy
Now that you've danced with Facebook's policies, let's waltz into the realm of Partner Monetization Policy.
